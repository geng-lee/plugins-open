# Clinical Calculations Project
I picked a handful on common clinical calculations to work on and used a bootstrap table to provide vaccine information.
The main focus was obtaining user input and generating clinically relevant information from that (such as creatinine clearance), 
but I also played around with some styling and formatting. 
* As of 3/20/2020, sertraline is the only drug that will work on the drug side effects input
  * Might add more later, but would have to adjust/change approach to significantly increase drugs included
* As of 3/20/2020, still working on:
  * Opioid dose calculator
  * Hypertension drug selector 
  * Antibiotic dose calculator
