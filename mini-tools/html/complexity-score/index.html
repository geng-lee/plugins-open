<h1>HCCP scoring</h1>
<p>
As Community Paediatricians we often discuss the increasing medical complexity of the children we see, but  have found it difficult to demonstrate this in a simple way. 
</p>
<p>
The Health Complexity in Community Paediatrics (HCCP) Score offers a rapid, reliable, easy to use measurement, that assesses acrice use.mber of domains, much like the APGAR score used for neonates at delivery. It has been shown to predict acute health service use.
</p>
<p>
This is useful for scoring health complexity in children known to community paediatric teams, supporting individual care plans and health systems governance and structuring.
